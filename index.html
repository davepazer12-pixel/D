        	Hello mel, it's me your koyah.. While im making this it's probably been a few days ago since ginawa koto much earlier than when I've actually send it sayo. Yes, it's a letter mel.. Well you're really gorgeous and many people really do want that beauty since it takes no effort to see someone's physical appearance, but what i seen in you isn't easily seen since it takes efforts to know you to actually pay attention to what's happening sayo, it takes attention to see what I've seen sayo.. It isn't just the beauty or the way you treat people outside but the way you are is what I've seen, that's probably what's gonna make you unforgettable to me. Since time is a powerful and omnipotent endeavour, im willing to fight it to keep this memories with you, honestly i noticed so many things about you like when your voice changes pag nag r-recite, when you cover your mouth pag tatawa ka since you don't want to bother people, when the time na solo ka and unborthered ka about things and those things din when you smile and you seem genuinely happy, when you carefully mind your words since ayaw mong makasakit ng tao, even though you're very very friendly sa lahat or socialize sa kanila often you really work hard when it comes to academic I can't help but admire how hard working and caring you are through things, i might not be available to tell u all about it because there's more to know about you eh but anyways, when your eyes change pag nasa labas tayo or kinakausap kita sa labas, when you're reading something and pag focus ka sa certain things na p-pansin ko yung eyes mo, I can't explain it but you seem very genuine and careful to every things na ginagawa mo and that what makes me admire you, there's more pa haa your laugh not the laugh when you're controlling it but the one when your laugh takes over your body the one you try to cover but that laugh makes everybody around u laugh eh, so keep smiling as long as you live haa i wouldn't want to see na hindi ka naka ngiti.. Then the time when nobody sees you but me, the time when you're hurting and hurting but you don't wanna bother anybody with your problems so you keep it all to yourself, like you own the whole world an apology, the way you have to be strong everytime even at the smallest time.. But even through all that you still show up to people with your whole heart.. When you genuine still show up even when you're busy and hurting and you still show up with a genuine heart, mel.. That's strength  and that's the kind of strength, u can't put make up on, can't be fake and can't be beauty outside and can't be recreate so don't ever think that it's worth ending it all because you have a strength of a million people that i admire. It makes me cry sometimes that you have to be strong all the time and can't even take a break or rest from everything.. All i could do is watch you silently, cheering you silently and admiring you silently because i don't wanna bother the peace you have right now.. I don't wanna give you more complicated things, so even if i have to do this things silently I would gladly do so even if i have to admire you through all of this senior high school life i would gladly sacrifice it, to admire you silently without ever looking back. You know that it doesn't matter if its the past diba? So i wouldn't care much sa mga things na hindi kona mababago, im gonna show it to you through actions na kayang kong mag hintay.. Na kaya kong ikaw at ikaw lang, even if it takes years or decades, what im holding on is not the memories but through my own will, so don't ever think na because we had a lot of fun memories together is dun ako mag h-hold on sayo but im doing this with my own free will, because i choose you even if hindi ako napili. Don't get me wrong ha, i cherish those memories but it shouldn't get in the way of the future, all i want is for you to be happy because that what you've wished for. through all those months of realization with you, I've finally developed this will hindi yung nag h-hold sa past which i used to.. You've help me develop this concept, the will to hold on to this.. Not through the memories but sayo, the who you are and ikaw at ikaw yung pipiliin ko because that's what my will want me to do. Also, I'm going to keep this feelings for you even if we don't talk anymore or we barely talk anymore, im gonna continue this feelings and develop myself to be worth of admiring you because that's my will. You're the one i want and that will be until my will to want you dissolve which is not soon. About the letters, that's gonna be sent soon. That's all mel thankyou.</p>
